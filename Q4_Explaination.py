We firtly create a python funtion and we have named it search().
This function passes two values which are the array and the number we are searching for.
 
We then declare our 'i' variable as we will need it to iterate through the loop. We create a while loop to range as many as the size of our array. We proceed to create an if statement where our current iterating value is compared to the number we are searching for. Return false if it is a match to stop the loop. Variable 'i' is then incremented if it was not a match, true is returned so our loop won't stop

We are then out of the funtion creation and we create our array and create a variable for the number we will be searching for. We can either write it ourselves or prompt it from the user but today I have written it myself.

We then deploy the funtion and write statements for whether it was found or not.
